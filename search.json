    "text": "I am a PhD student in the Computational Story Lab in the Vermont Complex Systems Institute at the University of Vermont. I am interested in the interplay between health and society, specifically through the storytelling within health ecosystem. Using natural language processing (NLP) and digital epidemiology, I hope to understand how largescale corpora relating patient and provider experiences can elucidate risk and protective factors across the global disease burden. Right now, I am particularly interested in pregnancy and maternal health.\nI graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 2014 with a Bachelors in Math, and a minor in Applied Statistics. I earned a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where I graduated with an MPhil in Evidence-based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation. I spent 8 years in the United States Army as an active-duty Medical Service Corps officer.\nI have fun outdoors. All my favorite activities involve spending time outside with my favorite people. I also love to read (anything and everything) from historical fiction to science fiction to fantasy and political thrillers."
