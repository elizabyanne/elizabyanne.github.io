I am a Vermonter through and through. I grew up in Northern Vermont and got my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Saint Michael's College. After graduating, I jumped right into my graduate studies at the University of Vermont in the Mathematical Science Ph.D. program and the Vermont Complex Systems Center.

When I am not at my laptop or reading papers, you can find me either in the mountains, where I am hiking or skiing, or at a Crossfit class.
