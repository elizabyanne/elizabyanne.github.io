  I am a Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. Student working within the Applied Math program, 
  and the Vermont Complex Systems Center. I am also NSF Trainee in the Quantitative and 
  Evolutionary STEM Traineeship (QuEST) program at the University of Vermont, 
  which allows me to bring my quantitative skills to interdisciplinary work.
