I am a third year PhD. student in the Mathematical Sciences program, however, most of my research and time is spent with people within the Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont. I am a member of both the Computational Story Lab and the Joint Lab, with advisors Chris Danforth and Laurent Hebert-Dufresne.
