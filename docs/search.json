After graduating, I immediately started my graduate studies at the University of Vermont in the Mathematical Science Ph.D. program and within the Vermont Complex Systems Center.\nWhen I am not at my laptop or reading papers, you can find me either in the mountains, where I am hiking, skiing, or ski patrolling, or at a Crossfit class."
